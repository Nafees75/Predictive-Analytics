Customer Segmentation Analysis for Supermarket Chain
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of customer segmentation for a large supermarket chain using a dataset of 4,000 customers. The analysis encompasses exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of clustering algorithms to identify distinct customer segments.

Overview
The customer segmentation dataset is designed to categorize customers into meaningful groups based on their demographic and socio-economic attributes. The analysis utilizes K-Means++ and Agglomerative Clustering techniques to achieve segmentation, with the aim of enabling targeted marketing strategies and enhancing customer engagement.

Analysis Highlights

Data Understanding and Preprocessing
Overview of the Dataset: Examination of key features including age, gender, marital status, education, settlement size, occupation, and income.
Handling Missing Values: Addressed missing values by applying appropriate imputation methods to ensure data integrity.
Feature Engineering: Derived new features and encoded categorical variables to prepare the dataset for clustering analysis.

Data Exploration
Demographic Distribution: Analyzed gender, marital status, age, education, income, occupation, and settlement size.
Correlation Analysis: Identified relationships between age, income, and settlement size.

Clustering and Evaluation
Elbow Method: This technique was employed to ascertain the optimal number of clusters by identifying the point at which additional clusters result in diminishing returns.
Silhouette Analysis: This method was utilized to validate the optimal number of clusters, confirming that four clusters (k=4) provided the clearest and most distinct segmentation.
K-Means++ and Agglomerative Clustering: Both clustering methods were applied and compared, with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) employed for dimensionality reduction to facilitate the visualization of clustering outcomes.

Comparison of Clustering Techniques
K-Means++ Clustering: This method produced four distinct clusters with clear separation between them.
Agglomerative Clustering: Similar to K-Means++, this method resulted in robust segmentation, demonstrating the consistency and reliability of the clustering results.

Key Findings

Cluster Profiles:
Cluster 0: Younger customers with lower income and basic education, primarily in smaller settlements.
Cluster 1: Middle-aged individuals with moderate income, a balanced educational background, and diverse occupations.
Cluster 2: Older customers with higher education and income, often holding skilled or managerial positions.
Cluster 3: Younger, budget-conscious individuals with lower education and income levels.

Recommendation for Marketing Strategies:
Cluster 0: Focus on trendy products via digital platforms and influencer collaborations.
Cluster 1: Emphasize family-oriented products with loyalty programs and traditional advertising.
Cluster 2: Target with premium and luxury products to highlight exclusivity.
Cluster 3: Offer cost-saving options and referral programs to address financial priorities.
